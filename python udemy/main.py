#task:

#1. Write a script that adds 15 and 30 and divides the sum by 2. Print out the answer.

x = 15
y = 30
z = x+y
print(z/2)
print(z/2)


#2. Initialize two variables and use arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder.

print(x+y)
print(x-y)
print(x*y)
print(x/y)
print(x%y)

#3. Create a variable called name and store your name in it as a string.

name = "tanvir"

print(f"hello, {name}")
