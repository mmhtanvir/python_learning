#task:

#1. Write a script that adds 15 and 30 and divides the sum by 2. Print out the answer.

x = 15
y = 30
z = x+y
print(z/2)
print(z/2)


#2. Initialize two variables and use arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder.

print(x+y)
print(x-y)
print(x*y)
print(x/y)
print(x%y)

#3. Create a variable called name and store your name in it as a string.

name = "tanvir"

print(f"hello, {name}")


#4. Create three variables in one line and assign each one a different food item.

x, y, z = "apple", "banana", "orange"
print() #x,y,z


#5. Print out "Hello" ten times using arithmetic operators.

print("helllo"*10)

#6. Set your name and age variables in one line with multiple assignment

name, age = "Tanvir", 18

print(f"my name is {name}, & I am {age} years old")

sentence = "my name is %s and Iam %d years old"
